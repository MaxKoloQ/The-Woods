As quickly as he could, Driev raised up on his back legs, claw high, then slammed down towards the ground, driving his talons into the beast’s exposed neck. 
With a squirt of blood and a desperate attempt to inhale through its now carved up throat, the hunter lurched up. In a flight of terror, 
it tried helplessly to breathe through the hole in his neck, as Driev withdrew quickly, slinking back out the burial site before the creature could react to him. 
He watched, from behind the gate, as the hunter grasped at his wound, blood coating his hands and chest, trying to drag in deep, dry breaths to no effect. 
Within moments, it crumpled into a heap, still and lifeless.

Elated by a sense of accomplishment, Driev once again made for the mountains beyond the forest, making quicker progress in the light of dawn; 
his new-found confidence allowing him to move more recklessly than he perhaps should. The fish had just slain the shark, and he couldn’t wait to let the others know. 
It was unheard of, for a monster such as the hunter to be struck down by one of his kind. In their history, he’d never heard of anything like it. 
But then, he thought, the hunters were ruthless and relentless, now.

Had he just shown them the Lokar were something to be feared and left alone, or a threat that needed to be taken care of? 
Fear unlike anything he’d ever experienced, not even while being hunted down in the dead of night for his own meat, gripped him. 
Would the beasts see that it was their own acts that led to such violence, or would they see it as an act of war? New and previously unseen aggression. 
The prospect of their wrath was without equal. Their weapons, tools, intellect and numbers made them an impossible foe to match.
As Driev finally reached the safety of the warm mountains and sanctuary he had craved all night, his heart was heavier than ever.

Should he tell the others? And if so, should he be bragging of his conquest, or warning them of impending catastrophe?
